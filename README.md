# Notes
The following types of damage will also be counted
<br>
・Damage from enemy attacks you receive
<br>
・Damage caused to minions (Greater One, etc.) that appear during the battle

The following time is also counted as DPS time
<br>
・When the Boss is invincible (during Watched, etc.) or when you are running away from the enemy
<br>
・Time spent in the Legendary Islands break room

Spells/abilities such as Guardian Angel will not be counted perfectly.
<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
   The server removes their damage indicator before final damage,<br>
   so this mod cannot detect damage dealt after that point.
</details>

Please note these will cause errors in the damage outputs
